DLNA.ORG_MAXSP - I've seen 5 here more than once but I donâ€™t know what it represents



AVTransportURI(MetaData) can be either a playlist or a single item.  If it is a single item then its values will be equal to CurrentTrackURI(MetaData)
	If it is a playlist then it's Uri will stay the same for each track in the list, but the CurrentTrack will change.
CurrentMediaDuration is the duration of the item identified by the AVTransportURI
CurrentTrackDuration:
	[+-]H+:MM:SS[.F+] or H+:MM:SS[.F0/F1]

	H+ means one or more digits to indicate elapsed hours
	MM means exactly 2 digits to indicate minutes (00 to 59)
	SS means exactly 2 digits to indicate seconds (00 to 59)
	[.F+] means optionally a dot followed by one or more digits to indicate fractions of seconds
	[.F0/F1] means optionally a dot followed by a fraction, with F0 and F1 at least one digit long, and F0 < F1
